# **GitHub Collaboration Explained** 🚀  

GitHub collaboration is **working with others on code using GitHub**. It allows multiple people to contribute to a project, track changes, review code, and deploy software efficiently.  

### **How It Works**  
1. **Version Control** – Git tracks changes in the code.  
2. **Branches & Merging** – Developers work on separate branches and merge them into the main project.  
3. **Pull Requests (PRs)** – Changes are reviewed before being added.  
4. **Issue Tracking** – Tasks, bugs, and feature requests are managed.  
5. **CI/CD & GitHub Actions** – Automate testing and deployment.

### **Common Collaboration Models**  

#### **1. Shared Repository Model** (Team Collaboration)  
- Team members work on different branches within a **single repository**.  
- Example: A development team building a Lightning Network app together.  

#### **2. Fork & Pull Request Model** (Open Source Contributions)  
- Contributors fork a repo, make changes, and submit a **Pull Request**.  
- Example: Contributing to Bitcoin or Web3 projects on GitHub.
