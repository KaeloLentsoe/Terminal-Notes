Great! Here's an explanation of **branching and merging** with an example to solidify your understanding.  

---

### **What is Branching?**  
Branching allows you to create separate lines of development in your repository. Each branch is an independent copy of the codebase, so you can experiment or add features without affecting the main branch.  

---

### **Scenario**: Adding a New Feature to a Website  
You have a repository for your website, and you want to add a new "Contact Us" page.  

---

#### Step 1: **Create a Branch**
1. Start with the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Create and switch to a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-contact-page
   ```
   Now, you’re working on the `add-contact-page` branch.

---

#### Step 2: **Make Changes in the New Branch**
1. Add a new file `contact.html`:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head><title>Contact Us</title></head>
   <body>
       <h1>Contact Us</h1>
       <p>Email: support@website.com</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
2. Stage and commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add contact.html
   git commit -m "Add contact.html with basic structure"
   ```

---

#### Step 3: **Switch Back to Main Branch**
Return to the `main` branch to ensure the changes are separate:
```bash
git checkout main
```

If you check the files in the folder now, `contact.html` won’t appear because it only exists in the `add-contact-page` branch.

---

#### Step 4: **Merge the Branch into Main**
Once you’re satisfied with your changes:
1. Merge the new branch into the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git merge add-contact-page
   ```
2. If there are no conflicts, Git will integrate the changes.

---

#### Step 5: **Delete the Branch (Optional)**
After merging, you can delete the feature branch:
```bash
git branch -d add-contact-page
```

---

### **What If There’s a Conflict?**
Conflicts occur when two branches modify the same part of a file. For example:
- Someone else updates the `<h1>` in `index.html` on the `main` branch while you’re doing the same on your feature branch.  

Git will prompt you to resolve the conflict manually:
```bash
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
```

You’ll need to edit the file, decide which changes to keep, and then commit the resolution:
```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in index.html"
```

```
